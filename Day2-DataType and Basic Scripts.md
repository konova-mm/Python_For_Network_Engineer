## Python Data Types
Python has several data types:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Boolean

These data types, in turn, can be classified by several criteria:
- mutable (lists, dictionaries and sets)
- immutable (integers, strings and tuples)
- ordered (lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries)
- unordered (sets)
-----
### Numbers
To perform various mathematical operations.
#### Integer

`print("1+2)`

`print("10-7)`

`print("12*5)`

`print("2**3)`

`print("10%7)`

-----
#### Float

`print("10/3)`

-----
#### Round() Function

 Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits.
 
`print(round(10/3.0, 2)`

`print(round(10/3.0, 4))`

-----
#### Comparison operators
`print(10 > 3.0)`

`print(10 >= 10)`

`print(10 < 3)`

`print(10 <= 10)`

`print(10 == 3)`

`print(10 != 10)`

-----
The int() function allows converting to int type.

```
a="11"
print(a)
print(int(a))
```

Convert To Integer
```
b=5.555
print(int(b))
```

bin() function produces a binary representation of a number (note that the result is a string).
```
b = bin(8)
print(b)
print(bin(255)
```

function hex() produces a hexadecimal value
```
print(hex(10))
```

-----
For more complex mathematical functions, Python has a math module:
```
import math
a = math.sqrt(9)
b = math.sqrt(10)
c = math.factorial(3)
d = math.pi
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
```

-----
### Strings
- sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
- immutable ordered data type

```
name = "konova"
print(name)

i = """
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
 ip mtu 1416
 ip ospf hello-interval 5
 tunnel source FastEthernet1/0
 tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN
 """
print(i)
```

Merge and repeats into one string
```
intf = 'interface'
tun = 'Tunnel0'
x = intf + tun
print(x)

y = intf + ' ' + tun
print(y)

z = intf * 5
print(z)

z = '#' * 40
print(z)
```

Strings are an ordered data type allows to refer to characters in a string by a number
starting from zero.
```
str1 = 'interface FastEthernet1/0'
print(str1[0])
print(str1[11])
```

To refer to a character from the
end, you can specify negative values.

```
print(string1[-1])
```

Make string slices by specifying a number range. Slicing starts with first number (included) and ends at second number (excluded).
```
str1 = 'interface FastEthernet1/0'
print(str1[0:9])
print(str1[10:22])
```

If no second number is specified, slice is until the end of string.
```
print(str1[10:])
```
Slice last three character of string.
```
print(str1[-3:])
```
Specify a step in slice. You can get odd numbers:
```
a = '0123456789'
print(a[1::2])
```
you can get even numbers:
```
print(a[::2])
```

Get a string in reverse order.
```
a = '0123456789'
print(a[::])
print(a[::-1])
```
len() function allows you to get number of characters in a string
```
line = 'interface Gi0/1'
print(len(line))
```
*****
Note: Function and method differ in that method is tied to a particular type of object and function is
generally more universal and can be applied to objects of different types. For example, len function
can be applied to strings, lists, dictionaries and so on, but startswith method only applies to strings.
*****

#### String methods
hen automating, very often it will be necessary to work with strings, since config file, command output and commands sent - are strings. Knowledge of various methods (actions) that can be applied to strings helps to work with them more efficiently. Strings are immutable data type, so all methods that convert string returns a new string and the original string remains unchanged.

#### Methods upper, lower, swapcase, capitalize
```
string1 = 'FastEthernet'
print(string1.upper())
print(string1.lower())
print(string1.swapcase())

string2 = 'tunnel 0'
print(string2.capitalize())
```

#### Method count
Method count used to count how many times a character or substring occurs in a string.
```
string1 = 'Hello, hello, hello, hello'
print(string1.count('hello'))
print(string1.count('ello'))
print(string1.count('l'))
```

#### Method find
You can pass a substring or character to find and it will return the lowest index where first character
of the substring is (for the first match). If no match is found, find method returns -1.
```
string1 = 'interface FastEthernet0/1'
print(string1.find('Fast'))
print(string1[string1.find('Fast')::])
```

#### Methods startswith, endswith
Checking if a string starts or ends with certain symbols
```
string1 = 'FastEthernet0/1'
print(string1.startswith('Fast'))
print(string1.startswith('fast'))
print(string1.endswith('0/1'))
```

#### Method replace
Replacing a sequence of characters in a string with another sequence.
```
string1 = 'FastEthernet0/1'
print(string1.replace('Fast', 'Gigabit'))
```

#### Method strip
By default, strip method removes blank characters. This character set includes: \t\n\r\f\v
```
string1 = '\n\tinterface FastEthernet0/1\n'
print(string1)
interface FastEthernet0/1
print(string1)
print(string1.strip())
```

Method strip can be passed as an argument of any characters. Then at the beginning and at the
end of the line all characters that were specified in the line will be removed.
Method strip removes special characters at the beginning and at the end of the line. If you want
to remove characters only on the left or only on the right, you can use lstrip and rstrip.
```
ad_metric = '[110/1045]'
print(ad_metric.strip('[]'))
```

#### Method split
Method split splits the string using a symbol (or symbols) as separator and returns a list of strings:
```
string1 = 'switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,100-200'
commands = string1.split()
print(commands)
```

By default, separator is a space symbol (spaces, tabs, new line), but you can specify any separator
in parentheses:
```
string1 = 'switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,100-200'
vlans = commands[-1].split(',')
print(vlans)
c = commands.split(',')
print(c)
```

Not by one whitespace character, but by any number. 
```
sh_ip_int_br = "FastEthernet0/0               15.0.15.1 YES       manual up           up"
print(sh_ip_int_br.split())
print(sh_ip_int_br.split(' '))
```
#### f-format String
F-string is a literal line with a letter f in front of it. Inside f-string, in curly braces there are names of
variables that will be substituted:
```
ip = '10.1.1.1'
mask = 24
print(f"IP: {ip}, mask: {mask}")
```

```
first_name = 'William'
second_name = 'Shakespeare'
print(f"{first_name.upper()} {second_name.upper()}")
```

```
oct1, oct2, oct3, oct4 = [10, 1, 1, 1]
print(f'''
IP address:
{oct1:<8} {oct2:<8} {oct3:<8} {oct4:<8}
{oct1:08b} {oct2:08b} {oct3:08b} {oct4:08b}''')
```

strings concatenation
Literal strings concatenation
Python has very convenient functionality â€” literal strings concatenation
s = ('Test' 'String')
print(s)
s = 'Test' 'String'
print(s)
s = ('Test'
     'String')
print(s)     


### List
List in Python is:
- sequence of elements separated by comma and enclosed in square brackets
- mutable ordered data type

Creating a list using a literal
```
vlan = [10, 20, 30, 50]
print(vlans)
print(vlan[1::]
print(vlan[-1]
print(vlan[::-1]
print(lent(vlan))
print(sorted(vlan))
```

Create a list using list function
```
list1 = list('router')
print(list1)
```

lists are mutable, list elements can be changed.
```
list = [1, 20, 4.0, 'word']
list[0] = nova
print(list)
```

nested lists
```
interfaces = [['FastEthernet0/0', '15.0.15.1', 'YES', 'manual', 'up', 'up'],
              ['FastEthernet0/1', '10.0.1.1', 'YES', 'manual', 'up', 'up'],
              ['FastEthernet0/2', '10.0.2.1', 'YES', 'manual', 'up', 'down']]
interfaces[0][0]
print(interfaces[2][0])
print(interfaces[2][1])
```
