### Python Data Types
Python has several data types:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Boolean
These data types, in turn, can be classified by several criteria:
- mutable (lists, dictionaries and sets)
- immutable (integers, strings and tuples)
- ordered (lists, tuples, strings and dictionaries)
- unordered (sets)
